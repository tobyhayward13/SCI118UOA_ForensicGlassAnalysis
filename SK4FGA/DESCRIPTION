Description: Functions for use when comparing and grouping glass samples by their features. 
  The package implements the Scott-Knott Modification 2 algorithm (SKM2) (Christopher M. Triggs and 
  James M. Curran and John S. Buckleton and Kevan A.J. Walsh (1997) <doi:10.1016/S0379-0738(96)02037-3> 
  The grouping problem in forensic glass analysis: a divisive approach, Forensic Science International, 85(1), 1--14)
  for small sample glass fragment analysis using the refractive index (ri) of a set of glass samples. 
  It also includes an experimental multivariate analog to the Scott-Knott algorithm for similar analysis on glass samples
  with multiple chemical concentration variables and multiple samples of the same item; testing against the Hotellings T^2 
  distribution (J.M. Curran and C.M. Triggs and J.R. Almirall and J.S. Buckleton and K.A.J. Walsh (1997)

  glass evidence, Science & Justice, 37(4), 241--244).
